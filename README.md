# CITE-seq of memory T cells from a TB progression cohort
*TBRU LIMAA*

## Overview
This repo provides code used for custom analyses of CITE-seq data from a TB progression cohort at immune steady state to identify a cell state reduced in people who had progressed to active disease. If you are interested in code for any additional analyses from our study, please contact us at aparnanathan@g.harvard.edu

## Data availability

Single-cell data are availale on GEO (Accession: GSE158769) and can be interactively browsed on [our website](https://immunogenomics.io/tbru/).
